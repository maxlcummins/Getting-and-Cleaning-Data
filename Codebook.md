# Codebook - Tidying the UCI HAR Dataset

The script ```Tidy_UCI_HAR.R``` downloads, extracts, reads, tidies and summarises data from the
UCI HAR Dataset for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project.

The tidy datasheet can be found here, the summary file can be found here while the README can be found here.



## 1.  Downloading and extracting the database files
* After passing a check to verify the files weren't already downloaded and
extracted, the files were downloaded using **download.file()** and unzipped to the 
directory "UCI HAR Dataset" using **unzip()**

## 2.  Files were read into R:
* activity_labels.txt -> ```activity_labels```
  Contains the activity labels that correspond to the activity codes in y_test
  and y_train
* features.txt -> ```features```
  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
  gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
* X_test.txt -> ```x_test```
  Contains test data from nine of thirty volunteers
* Y_test.txt -> ```y_test```
  Contains activity code labels for the test data
* Subject_test.txt -> ```subject_test```
  Each row identifies the nine participants from whom data was stored in ```x_test```
* X_train.txt -> ```x_train```
  Contains train data from twenty-one of thirty volunteers
* Y_train.txt -> ```y_train```
  Contains activity code labels for the train data
* Subject_test.txt -> ```subject_test```
  Each row identifies the twenty-one participants from whom data was recorded in
  ```x_train```
  
## 3.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* ```combined_data``` was generated by using the **rbind()** function on ```x_test``` and ```x_train```
* ```combined_subjects``` was generated by using the **rbind()** function on ```subject_test``` and ```subject_train```
* ```combined_labels``` was generated by using the **rbind()** function on ```y_test``` and ```y_train```
* ```combined_data```, ```combined_subjects``` and ```combined_labels``` were merged using **cbind()**.

*Note: This step, while reported here, was implemented later in the script, for
simplicity of selecting columns in step 4.*

## 4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Variable names were read into the data frame "features" before the following
manipulations, wherein instances of:
* "BodyBody" were replaced with "Body" using the function **gsub()**
* "^fBody" were replaced with "FourierTransformedBody" using the function **gsub()**
* "tBody" were replaced with "TimeBody" using the function **gsub()**
* "tGravity" were replaced with "TimeGravity" using the function **gsub()**
* "Acc" were replaced with "Acceleration" using the function **gsub()**
* "Gyro" were replaced with "Gyroscrope" using the function **gsub()**
* "Mag" were replaced with "Magnitude" using the function **gsub()**
* "-mean()" were replaced with "Mean" using the function **gsub()**
* "-std()" were replaced with "STD" using the function **gsub()**

## 5.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted using the function **select()**.
They were then assigned to the data frame ```tidysheet```

*Note: Prior to this, duplicate columns had to be removed using the inverted **duplicated()** function,
as seen on line 79 of ```Tidy_UCI_HAR.R```.*


## 6.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Activity names, as well as subject numbers, were bound to the data frame ```tidysheet``` using **cbind()**.
The activity names and subject numbers columns were renamed to 'activity' and 'subject' using **colnames()**.


## 7.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each            activity and each subject.
A second, summarised tidy data set containing the average for each variable, after grouping by activity and subject, was
created using the **group_by()** and **summarise_if()** functions, the latter of which averaged a column in the data frame
if it met the criteria **is.numeric()**.
